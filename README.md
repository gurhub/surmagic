# How to make a Universal (Fat) Framework

### What is a FAT library?
The iOS framework includes a **FAT (multi-architecture) binary** that contains slices for **armv7, arm64, i386, and x86_64 CPU** architectures. **ARM** slices are used by **physical iOS devices**, while **i386 and x86_64** are used by **Simulator** and are stripped from your app during the build and archive process. When a user downloads the app from the App Store, they receive only the architecture that their device requires.

### Why We Need?

* If you're building for iphonesimulator, you'll get a framework with an x86 slice but no ARM slice. 
* If you build for iphoneos, you'll get a framework with arm slice(s), but no simulator support 🤔. 

**Good News!** This script compiles for *both* platforms and *all* potential slices, merges the binaries produced from each, and produces a completed framework using the structure from either of the first two, single platform builds. 

**In other words** This script creates a Fat Framework that includes both.

### Info

This script uses and tested with this configuration:

* Tested on the [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) versions listed below:
  * 11.1 (11A1027) (this is where we started...)
  * 11.2 (11B52) 
  * 11.2.1 (11B500) 
  * 11.3 (11C29)
  * 11.3.1 (11C504)
  * 11.5 (11E608c) and above...
* and the [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) (CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects)


#### ⚠️ Warning 
That's why in the script file we're using the workspace instead of the target. So, **if you have a project without a workspace please update your xcodebuild lines** in the script file with code below:

```
xcodebuild -target "${PROJECT_NAME}" 
```

final result is something like this:

```
xcodebuild -target "${PROJECT_NAME}" -configuration ${CONFIGURATION} -sdk iphonesimulator ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO BUILD_DIR="${BUILD_DIR}" BUILD_ROOT="${BUILD_ROOT}" -UseModernBuildSystem=NO clean build
```

## STEP 1: Add a new scheme

**Warning:** This step is **not mandatory**. You can directly add in your current sheme. **But** I found a it's little bit risky for newbies.

If you're using the Cocoapods you need to copy all the other settings under your scheme. That's why we will duplicate our scheme instead of creating a new one.

Duplicate your scheme under Product → Scheme → Manage Schemes... menu. Make sure that the **shared box is selected**.

Edit your scheme name like line below: 

```
YourProjectName-Universal
```

* ⚠️ we will use this naming convention in our script file.

## STEP 2: Add a Run Script Action

Select **Project Target → Edit Scheme → Archive → Post-actions → Press “+” → New Run Script Action**

* copy-paste the script from [`this file`](universal.sh). 
* at the top of script file find the **Global Variables** section. And fill your target's architecture like giving example below the line:

**iOS**
```
DEVICE_ARCH="iphoneos"
DEVICE_SIM_ARCH="iphonesimulator"
```

**All Avilable Architectures**

| **Device**  | **Simulator**    |
| :----:      |    :----:        | 
| macosx      | -                |
| iphoneos    | iphonesimulator  | 
| appletvos   | appletvsimulator |
| watchos     | watchsimulator

* ⚠️ Under the **Provide Build Settings From** menu *YourProjectName* must be selected.

## STEP 3: Archive

Then run the Build > Archive on your Xcode.

The *Post Script* will be executed after the Archive is completed. And the Universal Framework would be generated and opened in project directory itself.

## STEP 4: Sending to the App Store

So, you move your archived Universal framework in your desired project. But, while you sending your application to the App Store you will face **"Operation Error: Unsupported architectures"** error. You have to remove the unused architectures from your Fat (Universal) framework before sending to the App Store. For this select the **Project, Choose Target → Project Name → Select Build Phases → Press “+” → New Run Script Phase** and than Name the Script as “Remove Unused Architectures”. 

And add the script from [`this file`](cleanforappstore.sh).

* ⚠️ Don't forget to change the line below with your Universal framework's name:

```
FRAMEWORK="YOUR_FRAMEWORK_NAME"
```

Thats All!

Best of luck! :v:

## Possible Errors

* If your project is unable to build via **xcodebuild** command for some reason, this script will not help you, and you'll get a build error. First, be sure that your project **can build on the terminal and try** this project.

## TODO

- [ ] Support for multiple frameworks in [`cleanforappstore.sh`](cleanforappstore.sh). But not all (this will cause an error because of Cocoapods frameworks are not fat frameworks). Use an static array 🤔.

## Communication

If you see a way to improve the project :

- If you **need help**, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios-universal-framework). (Tag `ios-universal-framework`)
- If you'd like to **ask a general question**, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios-universal-framework).
- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, open an [issue](https://github.com/gurhub/universal-framework/issues).
- If you **have a feature request**, open an [issue](https://github.com/gurhub/universal-framework/issues).
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/gurhub/universal-framework/pulls). It's better to begin with an [issue](https://github.com/gurhub/universal-framework/issues) rather than a [pull request](https://github.com/gurhub/universal-framework/pulls), though, because we might disagree whether the proposed change is an actual improvement. :wink:

Thanks! :v:
